# Elevator Simulation - CS Project 1C

This project simulates how an elevator handles user requests using custom data structures.

## How it works
- Each user makes a request (source + destination)
- Elevators pick up and drop off based on current direction
- Waiting time is tracked for every user

## Files
- Elevator.h — header file for the elevator class
- Elevator.cpp — logic for moving elevators
- main.cpp — simulation loop
